	\section{Exercise 1 - Questions}\label{E1Q}
	In irb and each of the primitives class and instance\_of? test the following to see types of object they are and explain why you get the answers you do:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item "hello there big boy"
		\item $56$
		\item 34.00 
		\item 0.222222354454365 
		\item ("a", "b", "c")
		\item +
		\item PI 
		\item Math::PI 
		\item add 
		\item hellow
		\item hello = 8 and then check hello with class "goodbye"
		\item (56 + 45.32)
		\item (56 + 45)
		\item 5.to\_s 
		\item "5".to\_i 
		\item five.to\_s
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\section{Exercise 2 - Questions} \label{E2Q}
	The following details the questions in section 2.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item "hello there big boy".include?("boy")
		\item "hello there big boy".include(" big")
		\item "hello there big boy".include?(" ere")
		\item What happens when you evaluate: ["a", "b", "c"] + ["d"]
		\item What happens when you evaluate: ["a", "b", "c"] + "d"
		\item Is there an easy way to capitalise words, so "hello" becomes "Hello" ?
		\item In the same vein, make "hello" "HELLO".
		\item Write a command to print out your name.
		\item Write a method to print out your name.
		\item Write a method to print out any name.
		\item Set up the varibles, maxi, dick and twinko so that they are all assigned numbers but two of them are assigned to the same numbers. Then show with a series of equality tests which ones actually have the same value.
		\item If you change the variables with the same number to be a Float and Fixnum does it change the results of the equality tests ?
		\item Do a version of these test using strings rather than numbers.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
		
	\section{Exercise 3 - Questions}
	What's a predicate?

	\section{Exercise 4 - Questions}
Define your own adding method that always adds 5 and 6 together.
So, my\_add\_five\_to\_six => 11.

		
\section{Exercise 5 - Questions}
Put this defined method in a file and call it using the ruby command outside of irb
